<h1>Hi, I'm Thelma! </h1>

🛡️ Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Risk & Compliance Professional 

Hi there! I’m a tech risk advisor with an experience in Big 4, helping businesses stay secure, compliant, and resilient. I’ve conducted physical security audits at data centres, navigated SLA frameworks, and now leveling up with hands-on cyber labs, breaking things (ethically), and building resilience into systems that matter.

👩🏽‍💻 Currently focused on sharpening my technical skills in cyber security.

🌐 Passionate about creating inclusive spaces in tech and mentoring women breaking into IT.

🧠 Always learning, always sharing — because knowledge only grows when it's shared.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and make the digital world a safer place.
