<h1>Hi, I'm Thelma! </h1>

🛡️ Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Risk & Compliance Professional | Women in Tech Mentor

Hi there! I’m a tech risk advisor with 3+ years in Big 4, helping businesses stay secure, compliant, and resilient. I’ve conducted physical security audits at data centres, navigated SLA frameworks, and now I’m diving deeper into the world of cybersecurity — hands-on labs, threat modelling, and all things cyber.

👩🏽‍💻 Currently focused on sharpening my technical skills in cloud security and incident response.

🌐 Passionate about creating inclusive spaces in tech and mentoring women breaking into IT.

🧠 Always learning, always sharing — because knowledge only grows when it's shared.

✨ Building towards my next big step: becoming a Senior Associate and a cybersecurity force to be reckoned with.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and make the digital world a safer place.
